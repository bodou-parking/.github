# Bodou Parking

## Overview

This is a parking reservation app that allows drivers to easily find and reserve parking spots at various parking facilities. The app aims to solve common parking problems such as limited parking space, inefficient parking spot allocation, and lack of parking information transparency.

## Architecture

The system consists of:

-   Client app: Cross-platform parking app for drivers including WeChat mini program
-   Management platform: Web dashboard for parking managers

-   Monitoring system: Tracks metrics and issues for devops

The backend follows a microservices architecture and is hosted on cloud infrastructure for high availability. Popular open source frameworks are used across the tech stack.

## Development Workflow

Agile methodology is adopted for the project. Daily standups are held to track progress and resolve impediments. Documentation such as user manuals, design documents, and operation guides will be provided.

## Future Improvements

-   Enhanced features based on user feedback
-   Performance optimizations
-   Expanded driver community engagement
-   Support for additional parking facilities and cities

The app will continue to evolve incrementally to meet changing user needs and market dynamics.
